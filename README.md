# Workflow Strategies

```
1. For each person we will create a different branch.
2. We will be building different features in the different branches.
3. Once finished, we'll be doing pull requests to the master branch.
4. Then we will meet and discuss what features are being pulled and we will merge it as a team.
5. Small pieces of code will be merged into the master branch.
6. Repeat the process.
