1. We will create each person with a different branch.
2. We will be building different feature in different branch.
3. Once finish, we'll be doing pull request to the master branch.
4. Then we meet and discuss of what feature are being pull and we merge it as a team.
5. Small pieces of code will be merge into the master branch.
6. Repeat the process.
